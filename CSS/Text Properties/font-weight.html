    <h1>Avengers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)</h1>
<p>The Avengers are a team of superheroes and the protagonists of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) media franchise, based on the eponymous team from Marvel Comics created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby in 1963. Founded by S.H.I.E.L.D. director Nick Fury, the team is a United States–based organization composed primarily of superpowered and gifted individuals, described as "Earth's Mightiest Heroes", who are committed to the world's protection from a variety of threats.</p>
<h2>Concept and creation</h2>
<p>Samuel L. Jackson makes his debut in a cameo appearance as Nick Fury, director of S.H.I.E.L.D., in a post-credits scene in Iron Man.[77] Jackson's face was previously used as the model for the Ultimate Marvel imprint version of Nick Fury.[78] Jackson confirmed that he had been in discussions to reprise the role of Fury from Iron Man's post-credits scene in the film's sequel, but that contract disputes were making a deal difficult. Jackson stated, "There was a huge kind of negotiation that broke down. I don't know. Maybe I won't be Nick Fury".[79] In February 2009, Jackson and Marvel came to terms, and he was signed to play the character in up to nine films.[80]

<h3>Captain America: Civil War</h3>
<p>In March 2014, Anthony and Joe Russo confirmed that they had signed on to return as directors for a third Captain America film, with Evans as Captain America, Feige as producer, and Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely as screenwriters.[169][170] Markus and McFeely had been working on the screenplay since late 2013,[171] while the Russo brothers began work in February 2014.[172][173] In April 2014, Marvel announced a release date of May 6, 2016.[174] In July, Markus and McFeely stated that they were midway through a first draft for the film, on which principal photography was expected to begin in April 2015.[175]
